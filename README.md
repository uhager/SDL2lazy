Just something to help me learn SDL2, a few things to make writing simple programs even simpler.
This is very much work-in-progress, no guarantees that anything works or ever will.

Compile with make for default, 
> $ make debug

for debug options.

Run 

> $ make dox

or

> $ doxygen Doxyfile

to generate documentation, or go to http://uhager.github.io/SDL2lazy/index.html.

The example directory contains an example program where I try to use some of the functionality already implemented in the wrapper.
