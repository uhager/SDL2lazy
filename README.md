Just something to help me learn SDL2, a few things to make writing simple programs even simpler.
This is very much work-in-progress, no guarantees that anything works or ever will.

Run
$ make doc
or
$ doxygen Doxyfile
to generate documentation, or got to http://uhager.github.io/SDL2lazy/index.html.

The wrapper-test directory contains an example program where I try to use some of the functionality already implemented in the wrapper.
